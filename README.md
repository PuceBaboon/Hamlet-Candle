# Hamlet-Candle

   Use plain text to provide a semi-random "flicker" to an LED candle.

   This is based on Pete Mills' original sampled candle idea, with 
   additional input taken from Martin Harizanov's "Funky Candle" (which
   was also based on Pete's work).

   The "American Constitution Candle" and the "Hamlet Candle" are written
   in JALv2 for a PIC12F683 microprocessor.  Both can use a single LED
   on the CCP1 output pin.

   You can use this code in whatever way you like.  You don't need to
   credit me in any way.  However, you really should credit Pete Mills
   for the original idea and Martin Harizanov for the other development
   work.

   If you re-write a version of this to work on the ESP8266, with text
   uploadable over the 'net, I'd really like to see it.  :-)
